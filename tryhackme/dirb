## DIRB – Directory Bruteforcing

### Context
Used during a TryHackMe room to enumerate hidden directories in a web server.

### Command used
dirb http://fakebank.thm

### Why this tool
DIRB was used to discover directories not linked from the main page.

### Result
The scan revealed /bank-deposit and /images directories.

### What I learned
- How directory brute-forcing works
- When to use wordlists
- Why false positives can appear
